			<p>Even though we may be miles apart, I want you to know that you are always close to my heart. Our love is not limited by distance, and I feel it every moment of every day. I want to see you terribly, but the thought of you always brings a smile to my face.</p>
			<p>You are such an amazing person, and I feel incredibly lucky to have you in my life. Your love and support have been a constant source of inspiration for me. Every time I think about you, my heart fills with warmth and joy.</p>
			<p>I am so grateful for all the wonderful moments we've shared together, and I'm excited for all the adventures that we have yet to experience. You are my best friend, and my lover.</p>
			<p>Thank you for being in my life, and for being the incredible person that you are. No matter the distance between us, I love you more than words can express, and I can't wait to spend the rest of my life making beautiful memories with you.</p>
			<p>Yours always and forever,</p>
