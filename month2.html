			<h4>Happy motmot, Bebu!</h4>
			<p>I can hardly believe it's been two incredible months since we embarked on this beautiful journey together, despite the miles that separate us. Distance may test us, but it only makes our love stronger and more profound.</p>
			<p>These two months have been a whirlwind of emotions, and every moment we've shared, every call we've had, and every text we've exchanged has been etched into my memory.</p>
			<p>I'm grateful for your patience, your understanding, and your unwavering affection. These two months have shown me that love knows no boundaries. As we continue to navigate this path, always remember that my heart belongs to you, no matter the miles that separate us.</p>
			<p>I know, I know, I'm writing this message like I'm cramming for an exam, but hey,  better late than never, right? Life's been a whirlwind lately, and I've been running around like a headless chicken, but that doesn't mean I forgot about our special day.</p>
			<p>Here's to more months and less cramming in the future, my love. Happy 2nd Monthsary! </p>
			<p>Yours always and forever,</p>
