			<h4>Happy 4th Monthsary, Bebu!</h4>
			<p>I am writing this letter with a heavy heart, regretting my behavior last night. I didn't mean to hurt you, babe. I was just so upset and I allowed my emotions to overpower my judgement, and I understand its negative impact on us. I apologize for being so thoughtless and not considering your feelings. <br> I am genuinely sorry, babe. I miss you and can't stand the thought of us not talking because of my mistake.</p>
            <p>I cannot help but cry as I write this letter, desperately seeking your forgiveness. I hope that you will forgive me, babe.</p>
            <p>It's been four months, and my love for you is as strong as ever. We've had disagreements and misunderstandings, but I'm always committed to us. Thank you for loving me as I am, even though I am sometimes hot-headed. Always remember that our petty fights will never take over our love.</p>
            <p>I hope and wish that our love continues to flourish, overcoming any obstacles in our path.</p>
            <p>I love you, babe. I can't wait to see you.</p>
            <P>Yours always and forever,</P>
