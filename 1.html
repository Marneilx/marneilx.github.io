			<h3> Hello Babe, </h3>
			<p>I am writing this to express my deepest apologies for the hurt and distress I caused you by blocking you recently. I understand that my actions were immature, thoughtless, and hurtful, and I sincerely regret my actions.</p>
			<p>Please understand that my decision to block you was never meant as a reflection of my feelings towards you or our relationship. In that moment, I was overwhelmed by emotions, and I made a terrible mistake.</p>
			<p>I would be grateful for the opportunity to talk about what happened, to listen to your feelings, and to offer a genuine apology.</p>
			<p>I sincerely hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me.</p>
			<p>I love you</p>
