            <p>Dear Marvie,</p>
            <p>Dear Marvie,
				I am writing this letter to you with a heavy heart. The last few days have been quite challenging for both of us, especially for you during these times of the year. I am sorry for hurting you because I lack understanding of your situation and am insensitive. I could've prevented the fight if only I had realized it.
				
            </p>
            <p>Babe, I'm sorry that I sometimes lose my patience when I could've just talked to you about how I feel calmly. Times like this really test our patience.<br>
            I hope you will find it in your heart to forgive me. You deserve better, babe. </p>
			<p>I will be better. For you, for us. </p>
			<p>I love you so much, babe.</p>

			<p>Marneil</p>
