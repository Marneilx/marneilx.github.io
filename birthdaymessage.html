                <p>I came across this meme that says every good friendship starts with ‚ÄúWhen I first saw you, I thought you were a bitch.‚Äù True enough because on our first day during SHS, I really thought you were, and now, I can fully attest that you really are üò≠<br>

                    <br>Kidding aside, I am glad that I was able to get to know you more in college. I did not just found my self a friend, but also a sister and partner in crime. To my duo in everything, may it be on our schoolworks, lates, absences, school shoes, and pink shenanigans, I hope we make it till we become CPA-Lawyers.<br>
                    
                    <br>Love you so much, teh! You deserve everything in life. Happy birthday üéà<br>
