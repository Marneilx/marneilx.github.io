			<p>I want to start by apologizing from the depths of my heart. I know that I've hurt you, and I'm truly sorry for my actions. These past few months with you have been nothing short of incredible, and I never want to jeopardize our happiness together.</p>
			<p>I understand that I've made mistakes, and I'm committed to making amends. Please know that I value you and our relationship more than anything in the world. I promise to learn from my errors and work tirelessly to become a better partner for you.</p>
			<p>Our journey together has been filled with laughter, love, and countless beautiful memories, and I want to continue building a future together, one where we grow stronger with each passing day.</p>
			<p>Thank you for your patience, understanding, and the love you've shown me. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me, as I'm determined to be the partner you deserve.</p>
			<p>Happy 3rd Monthsary, my love. Here's to many more months of love, growth, and happiness together.</p>
            <p>I love you so much babe! ðŸ’•</p>
