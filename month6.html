			<h4>Happy 6th Monthsary & Merry Christmas Baby!</h4>
            <p>It has been half a year and I love spending time with you. You have been my safest place and supportive girlfriend.</p>
            <p>I know we were both busy but seeing you through video call makes my day complete. We may have some differences and misunderstandings but it is just a part of our relationship, it shouldn't define us.</p>
            <p>I may not be perfect boyfriend but I am trying to be one. You know how much I love you and it won't change. I just hope that we can face some trials and problems together. Remember we are a team so if ever something is bothering you don't hesitate to tell me.</p>
            <p>May our love continue to grow like the Christmas spirit in our hearts. Here's to creating beautiful memories together this festive season.</p>
            <p>Merry Christmas to you and your family.</p>
            <p>I will see soon. I love you so much!</p>
            <p>Yours always and forever,</p>
