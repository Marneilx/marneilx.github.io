            <p> 
                I just want you to know how incredibly grateful I am to have you in my life. 
                 As we celebrate the day you graced this world, I want to promise you my enduring love, support, and companionship.
                <br>I wish you pure happiness and fulfillment.<br>
                
                <br>Though we've been through some challenging times together, each and every time, we faced them and became closer. This allowed us both to love each otherâ€”not perfectly, but as people who are perfectly imperfect. All my love, I give to you, babe; you'll always be my present and my future. I promise to love you the best that I can every day and to become someone who's deserving of you. I love you always, in every way.<br> 
                <br> I'm sorry I couldn't be there for your birthday ðŸ˜”<br>
               <br>Happy Birthday, baby!<br> 
               See you soon<br>
               <br>I love you forever and always.<br>
               <br>Marneil
