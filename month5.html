			<h4>Happy 5th Monthsary, Babe!</h4>
            <p>As we mark another month together, I can't help but cherish the emotions and experiences we've shared together. It's been a hell of a roller coaster ride filled with ups and downs, but through it all, my love for you has only gotten stronger.</p>
            <p>I am sorry for letting you down sometimes. <br>
               I am sorry for times when my overthinking and doubt have overshadowed me. <br>
               I want you to know that I am actively working on addressing these tendencies within myself. Not just for our relationship but for my own well-being as well.
            <br>
            </p>
            <p>I know things are hard for you right now and I want to remind you that I am here for you, babe. You don't have to do this alone. You are more than your struggles, and I'll be there with you to face whatever challenges come our way.</p>
            <p>On this 5th monthsary, let's celebrate the resilience of our love and the growth we've achieved together. Here's to more months, more love, and more understanding.</p>
            <p>I love you so much babe!</p>
            <p>Yours always and forever,</p>

            <em>"If I should think of love <br>
                I'd think of you, your arms uplifted,<br>
                Tying your hair in plaits above,<br>
                The lyre shape of your arms and shoulders,<br>
                The soft curve of your winding head.<br>
                No melody is sweeter, nor could Orpheus<br>
                So have bewitched. I think of this,<br>
                And all my universe becomes perfection.<br>
                But were you in my arms, dear love,<br>
                The happiness would take my breath away,<br>
                No thought could match that ecstasy,<br>
                No song encompass it, no other worlds.<br>
                If I should think of love,<br>
                I'd think of you."</em>
